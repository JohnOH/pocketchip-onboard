# This script will show onboarding images using a slideshow-like viewer (feh)
# usage: ./onboard.sh <FLAG_FILE> <IMAGE_DIR>
# example: ./onboard.sh ~/.config/pocketchip_onboarding ~/Pictures/
# This can be used for a general onboarding, or before running another script, such as pico8

# The user can choose to disable this by pressing 0 inside the viewer.
# A file (FLAG_FILE below) is used to keep track of whether the onboarding should be shown or not.
